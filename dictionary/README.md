Variables and Procedures
========================

A variable saves a value for later use. You can work with variables like "real" values like 3 or "foobar".
If you still do not know what variables are search the web and come back when you know.

A procedure defines a set of instruction which will be executed in the order they are defined when the procedure is called. Thus it is like a variable but instead of saving a value it remembers a set of instruction.

Defining variables and procedures has always these steps:

1. push the name of the variable or procedure on the stack (You must escape it with /)
2. push the value on the stack
3. define it with the _def_ operator.
